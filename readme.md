# ALien Invasion
### from Python Crash Course - Eric Matthes
---
### General info
This is a space invaders type game built courtesy of the Python Crash Course book,
written by Eric Matthes. I worked on this as my first larger project when
initially learning to program with python.

### Customisability
The settings of the game are highly customisable, through the settings.py module.
In this, you can customise the amount the ships speed up per level, the number
of lives you have, the shape and speed of the bullets, even the speed of score.

### Future tweaks
I plan to return to this to make a few small adjustments. I would like to add
sounds using the pygame module's inbuilt functionality, and also to keep the top
score consistently checked on different plays.
